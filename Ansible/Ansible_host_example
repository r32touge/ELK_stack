    #   - Comments begin with the '#' character
    #   - Blank lines are ignored
    #   - Groups of hosts are delimited by [header] elements
    #   - You can enter hostnames or ip addresses

    # Without the line, it should still connect, but a warning will likely appear without it:
    # [DEPRECATION WARNING]: Distribution Ubuntu 18.04 on host 10.0.0.5 should use
    # /usr/bin/python3, but is using /usr/bin/python for backward compatibility with
    # prior Ansible releases. A future Ansible release will default to using the
    # discovered platform python for this host. See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/
    # 2.9/reference_appendices/interpreter_discovery.html for more information. This
    # feature will be removed in version 2.12. Deprecation warnings can be disabled
    # by setting deprecation_warnings=False in ansible.cfg.
